This tutorial takes raw data from [**Anti-Defamation League (ADL)'s H.E.A.T. (Hate, Extremism, Antisemitism, Terrorism) database**](https://www.adl.org/resources/tools-to-track-hate/heat-map), which contains various incidents of hate, extremism, antisemitism and terrorism. These incidents are geo-coded to locality level. What we will do is (i) _filter a subset of incidents from the database,_ (ii) _convert localities into coordinates (longitude, latitude),_ (iii) _map them using different techniques_, and (iv) _produce a heatmap_, and (v) a couple of static maps.
